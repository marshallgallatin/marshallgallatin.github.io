title: Hello World

Hello there world!  This isn't a new introduction, we've met before.

## About Me ##

I'm still not sure how much I'm willing to share, but I'll leave you with something.

I'm a software engineer.  Yes I use the term engineer, makes it sound better don't ya think?  But really I wonder about the difference between software developer and software engineer.  I use engineer because to me it sounds like I think about what I'm doing more carefully.  Anyone can build a building (developer), but can you build one that doesn't fall over (engineer).  Anyway, I digress.

My background is in C++ driver development.  I really enjoy it.  I really like fixing bugs and starting new code from scratch.

## About this blog ##

This is a work in progress and I'm not sure how much time I'm going to commit to it.  Yep, still has the default jekyll theme (I'll probably update it at some point).

So what is the purpose of this blog.  Mainly just to document tips and tricks and little tidbits of life.

No purpose really, just a place to collect my thoughts.

See you later I guess.
