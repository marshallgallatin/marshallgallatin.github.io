title: Zigzag Conversion (Updated)
---

This one seems very fiddly: [ZigZag Conversion](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/).  

If you want to skip the naive attempt, [click here](#update)

My first naive attempt is as follows:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string convert(string s, int numRows) {
        std::vector<string> zigzagStrings(numRows);
        int stringPos = 0;
        bool backward = false;
        for(const char letter : s)
        {
            zigzagStrings[stringPos].push_back(letter);
            
            if(!backward)
            {
                ++stringPos;
            }
            else
            {
                --stringPos;
            }

            if(stringPos == numRows)
            {
                backward = true;
                stringPos = numRows - 2;
            }

            if(stringPos <=0)
            {
                backward = false;
                stringPos = 0;
            }
        }
        std::string finalstring;
        for (const std::string str : zigzagStrings)
        {
            finalstring.append(str);
        }
        return finalstring;
    }
};
```

The more I think about it, I think this is really not as complicated as I made it.  I literally just build up the strings by appending the characters in the right order and then concatenate them at the end.  I think there must be a way of knowing which character is next in the string based on the string length and number of rows, then it should be possible to just build the output string without actually putting the characters into memory on each row.

For example, for numRows = 5, the pattern looks like this:

```
0       8           16
1     7 9        15 17       23
2   6   10    14    18    22
3 5     11 13       19 21
4       12          20
```

* Row 0 are characters 0, 8, 16, etc, so interval is `numRows + 3`..... which is likely `(numRows + (numRows - 2))`
* Row 1 are characters 1, 7, 9, 15, 17, 23, etc... the patern is +6, +2, +6, +2, etc.   numRows + 1 alernating with numRows -3?
* Row 2 are characters 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, etc...  pattern is +4, +4, +4
* Row 3 are characters 3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 21, etc... pattern is +2, +6, +2, +6
* Row 4 are characters 4, 12, 20, 28, etc... pattern is back to +8, +8, +8


hrmmm.... there is a pattern here, I know there is, but getting the generic pattern is not apparent.

For example, for numRows = 2, the pattern looks like this:
```
0 2 4
1 3 5
```

For numRows = 3, the pattern is:
```
0   4   8     12
1 3 5 7 9  11
2   6   10
```

For numRows = 4, the pattern is:
```
0     6       12
1   5 7    11
2 4   8 10
3     9
```

Its late for me, I might revisit this tomorrow.  I am sure there is a pattern here, its something like the first and last row interval is `row0Interval = numRows + (numRows - 2)` (which is 8 for the 5 row case) and then the intermediate rows all have two numbers that add up to that number, so `row1IntervalA = row0Interval - 2` and `row1IntervalB = 2`.

I think I'm starting to see the pattern, might take another better stab at it tomorrow.

### <a name="update"></a>Update

So after looking at this I realized that I really didn't like putting all the logic about how to iterate through these strings just in a flat function, figured that it would be easier and better to put the iteration logic in, well... an iterator.

Here is my updated code, yeah, its way longer, and I think there are still some further optimizations that can be had, but it does complete in [7ms and beats 82.26%](..\images\post_content\zigzag_7ms.png) of code:

```c++
class ZigZagWrapper
{
    public:
        class iterator : public std::iterator<std::input_iterator_tag, char, size_t, const char*, char>
        {
            public:
                explicit iterator(const std::string& string, int numOfRows, int inputIndex = 0) : 
                    theString(string),
                    numOfRows(numOfRows),
                    lastRow(numOfRows - 1),
                    inputIndex(inputIndex)
                {
                    // TODO set these values if inputIndex is non-zero.
                    outputIndex = 0;
                    currentRow = 0;
                    distanceA = (numOfRows * 2) - 2;
                    distanceB = 0;
                    useDistanceA = true;
                }

                iterator& operator++() 
                {
                    if (numOfRows == 1)
                    {
                        ++outputIndex;
                        ++inputIndex;
                        return *this;
                    }

                    outputIndex += useDistanceA ? distanceA : distanceB;
                    useDistanceA = 
                        currentRow == 0 
                        ? true 
                        : currentRow == lastRow 
                            ? false 
                            : !useDistanceA;

                    if (outputIndex >= theString.length())
                    {
                        // overflowed, go to next row
                        ++currentRow;
                        outputIndex = currentRow;
                        distanceA -= 2;
                        distanceB += 2;
                        useDistanceA = currentRow != lastRow;
                    }
                    
                    ++inputIndex;
                    return *this; 
                }
                
                iterator operator++(int) 
                { 
                    iterator retval = *this; 
                    ++(*this); 
                    return retval; 
                }
                
                bool operator==(iterator other) const 
                { 
                    return inputIndex == other.inputIndex; 
                }
                
                bool operator!=(iterator other) const 
                { 
                    return !(*this == other); 
                }

                reference operator*() const 
                { 
                    return theString[outputIndex]; 
                }
            private:
                const std::string& theString;
                const int numOfRows;
                const int lastRow;
                int inputIndex;
                int outputIndex;
                int currentRow;
                int distanceA;
                int distanceB;
                bool useDistanceA;  // This might be better as an enum

        };

        ZigZagWrapper(const std::string& inputString, int numRows) :
            theString(inputString),
            numberOfRows(numRows)
        {}

        iterator begin() const { return iterator(theString, numberOfRows);}
        iterator end() const { return iterator(theString, numberOfRows, theString.length());}

    private:
        const std::string& theString;
        const int numberOfRows;
};

class Solution {
public:
    string convert(string s, int numRows) {
        const ZigZagWrapper zigZag(s, numRows);
        std::string finalstring;
        finalstring.reserve(s.length());
        for (const char c : zigZag)
        {
            finalstring.push_back(c);
        }
        return finalstring;
    }
};
```

This is obviously not completely production ready, this is only a forward iterator, we could also do a reverse iterator, its missing some functionality where the inputIndex doesn't equal 0 (the resulting iterator would misbehave).  But it gets the idea across.  Since this is an iterator, you could do other things with them other than just output the new string.

I found this problem much more interesting than the first two LeetCode problems I was given, especially when I started looking at it from a different perspective. I believe this seems like O(n) complexity, which is about as good as you can get for this type of problem, and it doesn't require any temporary strings or vectors to store the intermediate values.
