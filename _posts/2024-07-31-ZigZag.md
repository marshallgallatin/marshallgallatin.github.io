title: Zigzag Conversion

This one seems very fiddly: [ZigZag Conversion](https://leetcode.com/problems/zigzag-conversion/).  My first naive attempt is as follows:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    string convert(string s, int numRows) {
        std::vector<string> zigzagStrings(numRows);
        int stringPos = 0;
        bool backward = false;
        for(const char letter : s)
        {
            zigzagStrings[stringPos].push_back(letter);
            
            if(!backward)
            {
                ++stringPos;
            }
            else
            {
                --stringPos;
            }

            if(stringPos == numRows)
            {
                backward = true;
                stringPos = numRows - 2;
            }

            if(stringPos <=0)
            {
                backward = false;
                stringPos = 0;
            }
        }
        std::string finalstring;
        for (const std::string str : zigzagStrings)
        {
            finalstring.append(str);
        }
        return finalstring;
    }
};
```

The more I think about it, I think this is really not as complicated as I made it.  I literally just build up the strings by appending the characters in the right order and then concatenate them at the end.  I think there must be a way of knowing which character is next in the string based on the string length and number of rows, then it should be possible to just build the output string without actually putting the characters into memory on each row.

For example, for numRows = 5, the pattern looks like this:

```
0       8           16
1     7 9        15 17       23
2   6   10    14    18    22
3 5     11 13       19 21
4       12          20
```

* Row 0 are characters 0, 8, 16, etc, so interval is `numRows + 3`..... which is likely `(numRows + (numRows - 2))`
* Row 1 are characters 1, 7, 9, 15, 17, 23, etc... the patern is +6, +2, +6, +2, etc.   numRows + 1 alernating with numRows -3?
* Row 2 are characters 2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, etc...  pattern is +4, +4, +4
* Row 3 are characters 3, 5, 11, 13, 19, 21, etc... pattern is +2, +6, +2, +6
* Row 4 are characters 4, 12, 20, 28, etc... pattern is back to +8, +8, +8


hrmmm.... there is a pattern here, I know there is, but getting the generic pattern is not apparent.

For example, for numRows = 2, the pattern looks like this:
```
0 2 4
1 3 5
```

For numRows = 3, the pattern is:
```
0   4   8     12
1 3 5 7 9  11
2   6   10
```

For numRows = 4, the pattern is:
```
0     6       12
1   5 7    11
2 4   8 10
3     9
```

Its late for me, I might revisit this tomorrow.  I am sure there is a pattern here, its something like the first and last row interval is `row0Interval = numRows + (numRows - 2)` (which is 8 for the 5 row case) and then the intermediate rows all have two numbers that add up to that number, so `row1IntervalA = row0Interval - 2` and `row1IntervalB = 2`.

I think I'm starting to see the pattern, might take another better stab at it tomorrow.
