title: Jobs and LeetCode
---

For those that don't know, I was recently laid off from the Software Engineering job that I had had for the past 13+ years.  It is definitely weird not having a day job at the moment.  I am actively seeking employment, somewhere along the way I ran into [leetcode.com](https://leetcode.com/).  Well specifically I found this website that had ["60 LeetCode problems to solve for coding interview"](https://medium.com/@koheiarai94/60-leetcode-questions-to-prepare-for-coding-interview-8abbb6af589e).

Since I'm not currently looking at code every day, I figured why not, lets go ahead and try and get through all 60 problems, figured I'd post my solutions here (since the premium version is requried to save our code).  Also thought I could discuss and explain why or why I wouldn't do certain things.

So first question I attempted was #1 on the list, [Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum).

Seems simple enough, first I brute forced it:
```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        for(int index1 = 0; index1 < nums.size(); ++index1)
        {
            for(int index2 = 0; index2 < nums.size(); ++index2)
            {
                if(index1 != index2)
                {
                    if((nums[index1] + nums[index2]) == target)
                        return {index1, index2};
                }
            }
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

That worked well enough, but I realize it was slow (165ms according to LeetCode).  But the best performance gain you ever get is when you go from non-working code to working code.  How to optimize.

I knew there was some trick to this one, thinking I could just do the math once and look for the other value that matched instead of doing the math.  I screwed up and looked at the discussion that exact solution was proposed, so I went about writing it in C++ with the following result:

```c++
#include <map>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        std::map<int, int> seen;
        for(int index = 0; index < nums.size(); ++index)
        {
            const int& currentVal = nums[index];
            int diff = target - currentVal;
            if(seen.find(diff) != seen.end())
            {
                return{seen[diff], index};
            }
            else
            {
                seen.insert({currentVal, index});
            }
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```
This solution is way faster, it only loops once.  LeetCode tells me it runs in about 9ms (but I will say, the results vary, I submitted it a few times and it varied from 8-12ms depending on the execution).

Theres some things I don't like about this solution, but my problems mainly stem from the... well... problem.  Why are we returning a vector of indicies of items in the array.  If we were going to do anything with the items, why not just return a pair of references to the items.  I don't know, I guess it depends on context, this problem is very artificial as I assume most of these problems will be.

So this is pretty good, but I like to win, so I only beat 43% of the submissions, how could we improve.... here are some ideas:

1. The whole map insertion thing might be a bit heavy weight, maybe we don't really need a std::map to begin with.  
   * I wonder if there's a difference between using std::map::insert() and std::map::operator[] with assignment.  My gut says insert is better... 
   * is there a std::map::emplace, I think we might be constructing and then assigning, maybe we can just construct.
2. We do both a std::map::find(), and then we index into the map using operator[] to get the value.  std::map::find() should return an iterator, I _think_ we should be able to get the value directly from the iterator, that should save some time as well.

Lets see about these, first lets try emplace, see if that improves anything:
```c++
#include <map>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        std::map<int, int> seen;
        for(int index = 0; index < nums.size(); ++index)
        {
            const int& currentVal = nums[index];
            int diff = target - currentVal;
            if(seen.find(diff) != seen.end())
            {
                return{seen[diff], index};
            }
            else
            {
                seen.emplace(currentVal, index);
            }
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

Why yes, yes it does, brings the time down from 9ms to 4ms which beats 94.08% of the population.

Now lets see about just using the result from map::find()....
```c++
#include <map>

class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        std::map<int, int> seen;
        for(int index = 0; index < nums.size(); ++index)
        {
            const int& currentVal = nums[index];
            int diff = target - currentVal;
            const auto& possibleItem = seen.find(diff);
            if(possibleItem != seen.end())
            {
                return{possibleItem->second, index};
            }
            else
            {
                seen.emplace(currentVal, index);
            }
        }
        return {};
    }
};
```

Interestingly enough, that is slightly slower than just using emplace (8ms again).  Wonder if theres some optimization that the compiler is unable to make when using the iterator as opposed to just indexing into the map.

well now.... I went back to the previous code (using emplance and seen[diff]) and now I'm getting times in the 8-9ms range.  I guess that there is too much variablility in the systems running the tests to get very accurate results for time.  This makes me question LeetCode's ability to properly judge the results.  I'm using the free version, and every step I turn around it wants me to subscribe (for $35 a month no less, or do a whole year for $159).  Seems rather expensive to me, especially when I know there are other online judges.

I think this is where I'm going to leave it for now.  I'm not sure if I'll continue trying these LeetCode problems or switch to another online programming website.  I've used https://onlinejudge.org/ and https://www.spoj.com/ in the past, I think theres a HackerRank one now and probably others.

I guess we'll see.
